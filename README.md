Allowing buyers to see a better area to buy properties in terms of their requirements which is more economically feasible and at the same time provides multiple options from the given dataset.

This allows them not only to have a better property in terms of their own living (i.e., any unit with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms) from their areas of preference multiple options to check the availability of the unit.

It also provides an opportunity for them to profit if they are looking for it in terms of investments, as they would not be able to get price rates, but also data on where they will be able to make long term margins on investments.

### Key Findings:

The majority of zip codes in New York Manhattan and Brooklyn have higher property costs, and some of them donâ€™t. These zip codes are also popular in terms of rental rates, the number of available choices, and prebookings(occupancy rate) - they are excellent choices for investment.

Staten Island, Queens, and Sunnyside Neighbourhood have limited choices but they cost lower, are highly popular, and return higher rental prices. These zip codes were explicitly identified.

Zipcodes in Manhattan and Brooklyn have also seen high property price rises in the last 4-8 years. Staten Island and Queens have been constant for a long time. If the trends were to continue, both the areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn will make a great choice while considering a re-sale option if renting business does not go well as predicted.

Price and Availability are not inversely proportional. Consumers are ready to pay prices for better locations and other facilities provided to them.
